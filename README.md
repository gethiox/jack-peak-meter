# ULTIMATE SOUND VISUALIZER 2,000,000

Welcome!  
Well, it's not as ultimate as could be but also it's not so bad so far.

# Requirements

`ULTIMATE SOUND VISUALIZER 2,000,000`® uses [JACK Audio Connection Kit](http://jackaudio.org/) as base sound system,  
if you are using Ubuntu or another distribution with PulseAudio I have good news for you — You even don't need to  
download this piece of script on your computer. I made it for myself as first attempt into [Go](https://golang.org/)  
programming language. 

# Usage

    ./bar_renderer -title
    
# Build

    go build *.go
